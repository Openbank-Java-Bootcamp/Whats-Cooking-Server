# What's Cooking? Server

In the past, recipes were passed down through families on hand-written cards or gathered in cookbooks with notes jotted in the margins.
Now you can share all of your favorite recipes with loved ones near and far. Donâ€™t forget to include the secret ingredient!

What's Cooking? is a recipe management app that allow you to share your recipes with others. 

Each User is linked to one Cookbook, where they will save the Recipes they choose. 
The Cookbook can hold many Recipes. 
A User can make a Note per Recipe.

## Future Work
There are many things I would like to add to this project, especially more interactive features for the user such as:

Ratings system for user's to rate the recipes.

Ability for users to be able to follow eachother and receive recipe suggestions or notifications based on the recipes their connected users are adding.
